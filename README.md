I am a student in grade 12 and most of computer programming my experience comes from grade 10 and grade 11 computer science classes. I am comfortable writing programs with the languages Pascal and Turing. Computer science is the career that I'm aiming to pursue, I've applied the computer science programs for university. My favourite part about computer science is the problem solving aspect, I like the satisfaction of solving challenging problems. However, one part of computer science that I don't like is the repetitive nature and looking for bugs can be quite frustrating.
